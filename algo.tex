\section{Terminology}
Each object in heap has following attributes in object header. Some attributes can be saved using additional data structure in the heap during the collector processing the objects. 
\begin{description}
  \item[which(bit)] Each object has two reference counts in the header. which gives the index of the strong reference count.
  \item[RC[2](integer)] RC refers to Reference count. Each object has strong and weak reference count.
  \item[PC(integer)] PC refers to Phantom reference count. This count is used by collector during collection.
  \item[RCC(integer)] RCC refers to recovery count.
  \item[phantomized(bit)] Each object has a bit representing if it is under collector process list.
  \item[collector id(integer or uri)] Collector id not being null represent the mentioned collector id is processing object.
  \item[waiting(integer)] Algorithm uses termination detection algorithm technique to keep track of different phases of algorithm. Waiting represents how many messages an object expects to move to the next phase.
  \item[phantom\_link(bit)] Each link has this bit to denote if the link is phantom or not.
  \item[which\_link(bit)] Each link has a bit on the source side. The combination of which\_link bit and which bit on destination determines if the link is strong or weak.
\item[parent] Parent Pointer is used by termination detection algorithm to co-ordinate process/phase completion.
\end{description}
These attributes define the states of the object during garbage collection traversal. There are 9 phases to be precise. But in abstract, they are three phases that dominates the algorithm. Each phases has the two sub phases. One is the forward phase where new messages reach nodes and the reverse phase where all the messages comes back to the senders to notify that the messages arrived all the reachable nodes. 
\begin{description}
  \item[Healthy] RC[which] $>$ 0 \& PC $=$ 0 \& RCC $=$ 0 \& Phantomized $=$ false \& Collector id $=$ $\bot$ \& waiting $=$ 0
  \item[Weakly Supported] RC[1 -which] $>$ 0 \& RC[which] $=$ 0 \& PC $=$ 0 \& RCC $=$ 0 \& Phantomized $=$ false \& Collector id $=$ $\bot$ \& waiting $=$ 0
  \item[Phantomizing] PC $>$ 0 \& RCC $=$ 0 \& Phantomized $=$ true \& Collector id $\neq$ $\bot$ \& waiting $>$ 0
  \item[Phantomized] PC $>$ 0 \& RCC $=$ 0 \& Phantomized $=$ true \& Collector id $\neq$ $\bot$ \& waiting $=$ 0
   \item[Recovering] PC $>$ 0 \& RCC $>$ 0 \& Phantomized $=$ true \& Collector id $\neq$ $\bot$ \& waiting $>$ 0
   \item[Recovered] PC $>$ 0 \& RCC $>$ 0 \& Phantomized $=$ true \& Collector id $\neq$ $\bot$ \& waiting $=$ 0
  \item[Probable Delete] PC $=$ RCC \& RC[which] $=$ Rc[1-which] $=$ 0 \& waiting $=$ 0 \& Collector Id $\neq$ $\bot$ \& PC $>$ 0
  	\item [Simply Dead] PC $=$ RCC \& RC[which] $=$ Rc[1-which] $=$ 0 waiting $=$ 0 \& PC $=$ 0 
  	\item [Garbage] Simply Dead or  ( Probable Delete \& Originator)
  \item[Phantom Live] RC[which] $>$ 0 \& Collector id $\neq$ $\bot$ \& waiting $=$ 0
   \item[Building] RC[which] $>$ 0 \& RCC $>$0 \& Collector id $\neq$ $\bot$ \& waiting $>$ 0

\section{Link Deletion}
	Usually Link deletion is the prime event that can trigger collectors to clean heap if necessary. Link deletion can cause an object to be in one of the three possible states. 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Delete State
  \item Healthy State
  \item Uncertain State : Not Delete and Not Healthy State.
\end{itemize}
	Uncertain state is complicated state. Uncertain state can initiate collector traversal called phantomization which detects if the object is garbage or not. In certain cases, uncertain state can easily resolve the state by simply decrementing the reference count.
